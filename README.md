# SHIPMENT-Tracker
Shipment Tracker – Everything All At Once is a fully functional web platform that allows users to create and track shipments, delivery partners to manage their assigned deliveries, and admins to oversee the entire system.

Users can sign up or log in to view a dashboard showing total shipments along with their current status — in-transit, pending, or delivered. They can create new shipments, view recent activity, and track packages using a shipment ID. The shipment status is updated live, showing whether it’s in-transit, near the source, near the destination, delivered, or missed.

Delivery partners can sign up or log in to view shipments assigned to them, check source and destination locations, and update the delivery status (e.g., ETA 10 mins or Delivered).

Admins have access to a dashboard displaying the total number of shipments and customers. They can assign shipments to delivery partners and manage platform-wide operations.
